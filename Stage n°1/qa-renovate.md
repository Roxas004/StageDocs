# Renovate

## Introduction

Renovate is an open-source tool that automates dependency management and updates within a project. This documentation aims to describe its operation, configuration, and best practices.

## Objectives

- **Update Automation:** Reduce the time spent manually checking for dependency updates.
- **Security:** Ensure that the versions used are up-to-date and do not have known vulnerabilities.
- **Continuous Integration:** Facilitate the integration of fixes via automatically generated pull requests.
- **Customization:** Allow precise configuration according to the specific needs of each project.

## How it Works

1.  **Project Analysis:**
    -   Renovate scans configuration files (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) to identify dependencies.
    -   It checks with package registries (NPM, PyPI, etc.) if updates are available.

2.  **Pull Request Generation:**
    -   When an update is discovered, Renovate automatically creates a pull request including the necessary changes.
    -   These pull requests can be configured to be grouped or individual according to the defined strategy.

3.  **Verification and Validation:**
    -   Each update goes through the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to run automated tests.
    -   After validation, the changes can be merged into the main branch.

## Configuration

Renovate is highly configurable via a [configuration file](../.gitlab/renovate.json). You can define, among other things:

-   **Update Frequency:** E.g., daily, weekly.
-   **Grouping Strategies:** Combine certain updates into a single pull request.
-   **Version Restrictions:** Define rules on which updated versions to accept.
-   **Exclusions:** Ignore specific packages or folders.

## Best Practices

-   **Code Review:** Ensure that every pull request generated by Renovate is reviewed and tested.
-   **Automated Tests:** Integrate a CI pipeline to verify that updates do not introduce regressions.
-   **Rollback Plan:** Prepare a plan to quickly revert in case of a problem.

## CI/CD Integration

-   **Automatic Execution:** Configure your pipelines to trigger a test run as soon as a pull request is created by Renovate.
-   **Rapid Feedback:** Use static analysis tools and automated tests to identify potential problems as early as possible.
