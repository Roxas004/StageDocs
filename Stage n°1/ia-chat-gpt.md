# AI - ChatGPT

This document presents best practices and conventions for using ChatGPT in the project.

The objective of integrating ChatGPT is to improve team productivity by providing assistance for code generation, documentation writing, and troubleshooting technical issues. This documentation explains how to effectively leverage ChatGPT in accordance with the project's standards.

## 1. Utility of ChatGPT

- **Development Assistance**:  
  ChatGPT can generate code snippets, suggest refactorings, and explain complex portions of code.
  
- **Documentation**:  
  Use ChatGPT to help draft or enhance the project's documentation, as illustrated in this file.

- **Technical Support**:  
  ChatGPT offers guidance in resolving errors, provides tool recommendations, and shares best practices in development.

## 2. Best Practices

- **Clarity in Queries**:  
  Frame your requests carefully by providing context and clear expectations to receive relevant answers.
  
- **Validation of Results**:  
  Although ChatGPT is a powerful tool, it is mandatory to manually verify its suggestions before integrating them into your code.
  
- **Adherence to Project Rules**:  
  Contributions generated by ChatGPT must comply with the coding and documentation conventions of the project. For example, use the formats and style applied in the existing files.
  
- **Security and Confidentiality**:  
  Avoid sharing sensitive information in your queries and ensure that the suggestions respect the project's security policies.

## 3. Usage Examples

- **Generating a Code Snippet**:  
  ```bash
  # Example: ask ChatGPT to generate a PHP email validation function
  ```
  
- **Improving Documentation**:  
  ```bash
  # Example: ask ChatGPT to optimize the writing of a documentation section
  ```
  
- **Troubleshooting a Technical Issue**:  
  ```bash
  # Example: ask ChatGPT to explain an error encountered during compilation
  ```

## 4. Limitations and Warnings

- **Context Interpretation**:  
  ChatGPT provides suggestions based on the information given. An incomplete description may result in inappropriate recommendations.
  
- **Data Currency**:  
  ChatGPT's responses are based on a dataset that may become outdated. When in doubt, always cross-check with the official documentation or consult domain experts.

By following these recommendations, integrating ChatGPT into your development workflow aims to boost efficiency while ensuring high quality and secure code.
